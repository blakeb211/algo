## Build instructions
   - For R examples, run directly in R using either 
   ```
      R
      source("filename.r")
   ```
     or opening the file in RStudio.
   - For c++ examples, install SDL2, go to the build directory and type: 
   ``` 
       cmake ..
       make
   ```
     or modify the *build.sh* script to suit your purposes.
