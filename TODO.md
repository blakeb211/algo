## TODO
  - pick next algorithm

## IMPROVEMENTS
  - @point-in-polygon could add other 2 intersection cases to are_intersecting() method but
    case3 sufficient for this dynamic integration test
  - @convexhull left hand turn function of convexhull could be simplified 
    (at least in terms of explanation if not computation) using 
    a 2d vector cross product (x1y2 - x2y1)
  - @convexhull add additional tests to c++ version
